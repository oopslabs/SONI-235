Course Outcome 1 (CO1): 
1. Define a class ‘product’ with data members pcode, pname and price. Create 3 objects of 
the class and find the product having the lowest price. 
2. Read 2 matrices from the console and perform matrix addition. 
3. Add complex numbers 
4. Read a matrix from the console and check whether it is symmetric or not. 
5. Create CPU with attribute price. Create inner class Processor (no. of cores, manufacturer) 
and static nested class RAM (memory, manufacturer). Create an object of CPU and print 
information of Processor and RAM. 

Course Outcome 2 (CO2) 
1. Program to Sort strings 
2. Search an element in an array. 
3. Perform string manipulations 
4. Program to create a class for Employee having attributes eNo, eName eSalary. Read n 
employ information and Search for an employee given eNo, using the concept of Array of objects

Course Outcome 3(CO3): 
1. Area of different shapes using overloaded functions 
2. Create a class ‘Employee’ with data members Empid, Name, Salary, Address and 
constructors to initialize the data members. Create another class ‘Teacher’ that inherit the 
properties of class employee and contain its own data members department, Subjects taught 
and constructors to initialize these data members and also include display function to 
display all the data members. Use array of objects to display details of N teachers. 
3. Create a class ‘Person’ with data members Name, Gender, Address, Age and a constructor 
to initialize the data members and another class ‘Employee’ that inherits the properties of 
class Person and also contains its own data members like Empid, Company_name, 
Qualification, Salary and its own constructor. Create another class ‘Teacher’ that inherits 
the properties of class Employee and contains its own data members like Subject, 
Department, Teacherid and also contain constructors and methods to display the data 
members. Use array of objects to display details of N teachers. 
4. Write a program has class Publisher, Book, Literature and Fiction. Read the information
